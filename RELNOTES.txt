                            Release Notes for
               P4Python, Helix Core API for Python

                             Version 2022.2

Introduction

  This document lists all user-visible changes to P4Python starting
  from release 2007.3, the first supported P4Python release.

  Perforce numbers releases YYYY.R/CCCCC, for example, 2007.3/30547.
  YYYY is the year; R is the release of that year; CCCCC is the
  bug fix change level. Each bug fix in these release notes is
  marked by its change number. Any build includes all bug fixes
  of all previous releases and all bug fixes of the current
  release up to the bug fix change level.

  To display the version of P4Python you have installed,
  start Python and issue the following commands:

    >>> import P4
    >>> print(P4.P4.identify())

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important End-of-Life Notice

    This major release of P4Python would be the last to provide installation
    package for and test against Ubuntu 18.04. This is part of our commitment to
    focus on supported technology platforms

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation

  Installation via pip

    P4Python can be installed via pip from 2015.1 onwards. Simply run
    the command

      python3 -m pip install p4python

    Note that previous versions of P4Python should be uninstalled first,
    since they were built using distutils and not setuptools (the installer
    will warn about this). Once installed via pip, future releases of
    P4Python can be installed by adding the upgrade option to pip

      python3 -m pip install --upgrade p4python

    P4Python is distributed as a binary wheels for Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 
    3.10. In order for the binary wheel to be used, the ABI tag needs to match.
    This often requires updated pip, to do so issue:
      python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

  Installation using Linux binary packages

    P4Python can be installed via Linux packages available from:
    https://www.perforce.com/perforce-packages

    Following packages are available:

    RHEL 8      
        perforce-p4python3-python3.8
        perforce-p4python3-python3.9

    Ubuntu 18.04      
        perforce-p4python3-python3.7
        perforce-p4python3-python3.8

    Ubuntu 20.04      
        perforce-p4python3-python3.8
        perforce-p4python3-python3.9

    Ubuntu 22.04      
        perforce-p4python3-python3.10

  Installing P4Python for Maya.

    Maya has a private python executable called "mayapy".

    The instructions for installation are the same as the source install
    below, except use "mayapy" instead of "python".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upgrading P4Python

  When manually upgrading (not using pip or package managers), uninstall any
  older versions of P4Python. Some earlier versions of P4Python consisted of
  the following files, which must be deleted before installing a later version:

    p4.py
    p4.pyc
    p4.pyo
    P4Client.pyd

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building P4Python from Source

  1. Download the r22.2 Perforce C++ API from the Perforce FTP site at
     "ftp://ftp.perforce.com/perforce". The API archive is located
     in release and platform-specific subdirectories.

     Under Linux the p4api is named p4api-glib<GLIBVER>-openssl<SSLVER>.tgz
           Note that setup.py will download the correct p4api automatically from
           ftp.perforce.com if you do not provide an --apidir parameter to the 
           setup.py "build" command.

     Mac OS X users should get the API from the relevant platform directory e.g.
     "bin.macosx1010x86_64" or "bin.macosx12arm64". The p4api is named
     p4api-openssl<SSLVER>.tgz

     Under Windows the p4api needs to match your compiler, build type (static 
     or dynamic) and SSL version.  for instance:

           "p4api_vs2010_static_openssl1.1.1.zip" or 
           "p4api_vs2015_dyn_openssl1.0.2.zip"

     Note: 32-bit builds of P4Python require a 32-bit version of the
           C++ API and a 32-bit version of Python. 64-bit builds of
           P4Python require a 64-bit version of the C++ API and a
           64-bit version of Python.

     Unzip the archive into an empty directory.

  2. Download and extract the P4Python API archive into a new, empty directory.

  3. If needed, install the Openssl libraries.

  4. To build P4Python, run the following command:

     python3 setup.py build --apidir <Perforce C++ API absolute path> 
     --ssl <OpenSSL library path>

     Note: in order to reinstall cleanly P4Python, remove the
           directory named "build".

  5. To test your P4Python build, run the following command:

     python3 p4test.py

     Note: this test harness requires the Perforce server executable
           p4d 17.1 or better to be installed and in the PATH.

  6. To install P4Python, run the following command:

     python3 setup.py install

     if this doesn't work, you may need to both build and install in the same 
     incantation:

     python3 setup.py build --apidir <Perforce C++ API absolute path> 
     --ssl <OpenSSL library path> install

     Note: on Unix/Mac platforms, the installation must be performed
           as the root user, so usually these commands are preceded by "sudo".
           Also ensure that the umask is set correctly (typically 0022) before 
           running the install. With a umask of 027, for example, the resulting 
           installed files are accessible only by users of group root.

     Note: on Windows platforms, open a Visual Studio Command window 
     (with administrator permissions) and run the command there.

  SSL support
  -----------

    Perforce Server 2012.1 and later supports SSL connections and the
    C++ API has been compiled with this support. With 2020.1 SSL support
    is mandatory, that is, P4Python must be linked with valid OpenSSL libraries.

    To specify which SSL library to use, provide the --ssl [librarypath]
    switch to the build. Without [librarypath] setup will attempt to run
    "openssl version" to identify the location of the library path for
    openssl and whether openssl has an appropriate version to link to.

    If on linux, and the build process cannot find the correct openssl 
    libraries, and the -ssl option was not used, then the openssl source will 
    be downloaded, compiled and installed (this will require a superuser 
    password for the installation)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility Statements

  Server Compatibility

    You can use any release of P4Python with any release of the
    Perforce server later than 2001.1

  API Compatibility

    This release of P4Python requires at least 2022.2 Perforce API 
    (2022.2/2407422). Older releases will not compile and are not supported.

  Python Compatibility

    This release of P4Python is supported building from source with 
    Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10.

    For detailed compatibility, please check the following table:

    Python Release | P4Python Release
    ======================================
    2.7            | 2010.1 up to 2022.1 (unsupported)
    3.3            | 2012.3 up to 2019.1 (unsupported)
    3.4            | 2014.1 up to 2019.1 (unsupported)
    3.5            | 2014.1 up to 2020.1 (unsupported)
    3.6            | 2016.2 up to 2022.1 (unsupported)
    3.7            | 2018.2 or later
    3.8            | 2020.1 or later
    3.9            | 2021.1 or later
    3.10           | 2022.1 or later

  OpenSSL Compatibility

    To build P4Python with encrypted communication support, you must use the
    version of OpenSSL that Perforce C/C++ API has been built against.

    Beginning with the 2017.1 release of the Helix C/C++ API, the dependency on
    OpenSSL is now enforced and the SSL stub library has been removed.
    Executables linked against the P4API libraries must also be linked against
    real OpenSSL libraries: The latest 3.0.x or 1.1.1 patch is recommended

  Platform Compatibility

    This release is certified on the following platforms:

    Windows (x86, x86_64)
        Server 2016
    Mac OS X
        10.15, 11, 12 (x86_64)
        12, 13 (ARM64)
    Linux (x86, x86_64)
        Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, 22.04
        CentOS 8
        Rocky Linux 9.1

    The above platforms are tested and subject to regression testing on a frequent basis.
    Errors or bugs discovered in these platforms are prioritized for correction. 
    Any platform not listed above is not actively tested by Perforce. 
    P4Python may run on platforms that are not actively tested.

  Compiler Compatibility

    To build P4Python from source, you must use a version of P4Python that has
    been compiled with the same compiler used to build the Perforce C++ API.
    For most platforms, use gcc/g++.

    On Linux since the 2019.1 P4API release, due to a change in library 
    dependencies, the source code requires gcc 6 or above to be used.

    Attempting to use a different compiler or a different version of the
    compiler will cause link errors due to differences in name handling.

    For more information about P4API compiler requirements, please see this link:
    https://www.perforce.com/manuals/p4api/Content/P4API/client.programming.compiling.html

    On Windows platforms, the P4Python installer is build with Python from
    python.org. The installer for Python 3.x was built with Visual Studio 2017
    and Visual Studio 2008 for Python 2.

    To run Python 3.x on Windows, it might be necessary to install the
    redistributable version of the 2017 libraries, vc_redist.x64.exe or
    vc_redist.x86.exe, respectively for 64 bit and 32 bit.
    Without these libraries the DLL for P4API will not load into Python and
    the command 'import P4' will fail.

  Known Limitations

    The Perforce client-server protocol is not designed to support
    multiple concurrent queries over the same connection. For this
    reason, multi-threaded applications using the C++ API or the
    script APIs (P4Perl, P4Ruby, etc.) should ensure that a
    separate connection is used for each thread or that only one
    thread may use a shared connection at a time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attributes

  Perforce P4Python provides the attributes listed below. Attributes
  can be set in the P4() constructor or by using their setters and
  getters. For example:

    >>> import P4
    >>> p4 = P4.P4(client="myclient", port="1666")
    >>> p4.user = 'me'

  Most attributes can be set and read. Attributes are strings unless
  noted otherwise.

    api_level           API compatibility level, INTEGER

    charset             The character set to use. String,
                        not a constant as in previous versions

    client              Client to use (P4CLIENT)

    cwd                 Current Working Directory

    debug               Debug level (for debugging P4Python), INTEGER

    errors              Array of errors returned by the server
                        (Read-Only), LIST

    exception_level     Determines whether exceptions are thrown,
                        INTEGER

    host                Client Host

    input               Input for next command, can be STRING, LIST
                        or DICTIONARY

    maxlocktime         MaxLockTime for commands, INTEGER

    maxresults          MaxResults for commands, INTEGER

    maxscanrows         MaxScanRows for commands, INTEGER

    p4config_file       Returns the config file path (Read-Only)

    ignore_file         Ignore file used

    password            Value of P4PASSWD

    port                Value of P4PORT

    prog                Name of the script, shown in the server log

    server_level        Returns the server level (Read-Only)

    tagged              Boolean value, determines whether to use
                        tagged mode, INTEGER

    ticket_file         Returns the name of the ticket file

    user                Value of P4USER

    warnings            Array of warnings returned by the server
                        (Read-Only), LIST

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tagged mode and form parsing

  In Perforce P4Python 2007.3 and later, form parsing and tagged
  output are enabled by default. (In Public Depot P4Python,
  tagged output and form parsing mode were disabled by default,
  but most scripts enabled them immediately.)

  Form parsing cannot be disabled explicitly, but tagged output can
  be enabled or disabled by setting p4.tagged as follows:

    p4.tagged = False    # Disabled
    p4.tagged = True    # Enabled

  This method can be used to disable form parsing, because
  form parsing does not work when tagged output is
  disabled.

  #1804040 (Job #98777) * ***
      P4Python now requires p4api 2019.1
      Added OSX support for 10.14,  removed support for 10.8 and earlier
      Added additional libraries from p4api 19.1 to the link lines on all 
      platforms. Fixed name conflicts between p4python modules and p4api

  #1812102 (Job #98261) *
      P4Python attempts to download P4API every time, ignoring --apidir

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2018.2

  #1725050 (Job #95692) *
      Added support for Python 3.7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2017.2

Bug fixes in 2017.2
  #1612945 (Job #85554, #94070) *
      Removed memory leak (and potential crashes) caused by P4.P4Message,
      P4.P4MergeData, P4.P4ActionMergeData and P4.P4Map not being
      correctly initialised.

  #1614534 (Job #93512) *
      Protect p4.run_resolve(resolver=Resolver()).
      If the resolver object returns anything but a string, check and
      throw a warning instead of crashing Python.

  #1613710 (Job #90903) *
      Extend the prog string with the Python, P4Python and P4API version
      to enhance debugging and logging. The appended string looks like
      this [PY3.6.3/P4PY2017.2/API2018.1/1592142] and will be appended
      even if P4.prog is set by the user.

  #1613337 (Job #93280) *
      Clean up temporary P4API files if downloaded from the ftp site. This
      is particular useful if P4Python is installed via pip by multiple
      users on a shared server.

  #1562323 (Job #92590) *
      Permit assignment of single string values to spec fields that
      require a list, for example the 'View' or 'AltRoots' field in the
      client spec. The string is treated like an array of 1 element. When
      reloading the spec, the field will be converted to an array.

  #1602183 (Job #86321) *
      Ensure context handlers correctly reset values if an exception is
      thrown inside the body of the context handler. This also applies if
      the context is set inside the run method as a karg, for example:
        p4.run_info(tagged=False)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2017.1

  #1525945 *
      Protect automatic P4Python installs from P4API changes. This makes sure
      that 'pip install p4python' on Linux uses the tested version of P4API.

  #1523857 *
      Added support for graph depots (Helix4Git). P4.graph is set to 1
      by default to enable graph commands. Support can be disabled by setting
      P4.graph to 0.

  #1500363  (Job #90902) *
      Added support for P4.p4config_files, which returns a list of p4config
      files in case of nested usage. P4.p4config_file (note the missing s)
      only returns the outermost config file.

  #1501292 *
      Added support for setting (client-side) tunables:
          P4.set_tunable(key, value)
          P4.get_tunable(key)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2016.2

  #1446623 * ** ***
      Added support for P4Map.translate_array.
      This method is useful when translating ditto (&) mapping, which can
      result in more than one answer.

Bug fixes in 2016.2:

  #1477171 (Job #89757) *
      Fixed parsing expression for the output of 'openssl version' for
      1.0.2. This fix allows P4Python to be build with SSL support on
      Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) when installing via pip.

  #1436215 *
      P4.clone() without a directory parameter would segfault if the
      target directory is already in use. Now the exception will print
      out directory '.' instead.

Bug fixes in 2016.2 Patch 1

  #1497579 (Job #90749) *
      Removed spurious output of "*** It is not a list, I am confused"
      when parsing hand-crafted spec strings with added comments.

  #1493809 *
      Protect encoding test case from crashing macOS Sierra (10.12)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2016.1

  #1399690 * ** ***
      Comments in the protection table are now supported by P4.Spec.
      The comment is preserved as part of each protection table entry,
      so a script parsing the protection table needs to be able to expect
      an entry to be followed by a hash (#) and a comment.

  #1369476 (Job #83827) *
      Installing P4Python via pip under Linux will now attempt to link
      against the OpenSSL libraries if installed. If no suitable OpenSSL
      library can be found, P4Python will be installed without SSL support.

  #1349961 * **
      Added P4.define_spec, which makes it possible to preload the spec cache
      with a spec definition. This is particularly useful when used with
      form-triggers that use the new 2016.1 variable %specdef%.

  #1349960 * ** ***
      Support for ditto (&) mapping in P4.Map.

Bugs fixed in 2016.1 Patch 1:

  #1445730 (Job #88664) *
      P4.Map() correctly handles overlay mappings again.

  #1442582 (Job #88605)
      P4.run_login now takes an optional "password" keyword. This
      simplifies the login process from this:
          p4.password = "secret"
          p4.run_login()
      to this:
          p4.run_login(password="secret")

  #1443446 (Job #88606)
      Logging interface now logs warnings and errors as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2015.2

Bugs fixed in 2015.2

  #1315696
      Added arguments and keyword arguments (args and kargs) to
      P4.run_login and P4.run_password for completeness.

  #1319215 (Job #81071)
      Use C++ P4API for 'p4 init' and 'p4 clone'. The 2015.1
      implementation required a P4 executable in the path of the script.

  #1316068 (Job #84024)
      Updated the spec map in line with the 2015.2 server changes.

Bugs fixed in 2015.2 Patch 1

  #1338889 (Job #84749)
      Improve encoding for Python3 to allow sending Unicode strings
      to a non-Unicode server without converting the strings to UTF8.
      Also adds the ability to encode strings yourself and send bytes-
      encoded strings instead.

  #1340547
      Fixed spec string for "typemap", "protect" and "triggers" commands.

  #1341514
      Added test cases for spec parsing and formatting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2015.1

  #1039185 (Job #78154) * **
      Support for new DVCS commands 'p4 init' and 'p4 clone'. The commands
      are implemented as factory methods P4.init and P4.clone respectively
      and create a new P4 instance pointing to the DVCSworkspace.

  #1005721 (Job #062356) *
      Support for PyPi. P4Python can now be installed with a simple:
          pip install p4python
      on many supported platforms as a binary install, and as source on
      Linux, where it will attempt to automatically build.

  #1042731 *
      Support for automatically downloading P4API on appropriate
      platforms. If P4Python is built without the --apidir switch, setup
      will now attempt to connect to ftp.perforce.com to download the
      correct P4API binary for this platform and unpack it in a temporary
      directory.

  #1042578 *
      Support for automatic SSL-enabled builds. If the switch --ssl is
      provided without a path, setup will attempt to determine the correct
      path of the SSL libraries by running 'openssl version'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2014.2

  #945604 * ***
      P4ENVIRO file can now be enquired and set within P4Python through
      the string variable P4.p4enviro_file.

  #948607 *
      Support Python logging interface.
      When a Python logger is assigned to P4.logger, P4Python will log all
      commands executed through the P4.run interface as INFO.
      Additionally, any warning or error from Perforce is reported as
      INFO, WARNING or ERROR in the log. By setting a logger, P4.debug is
      automatically set to 1 to facilitate command logging. Setting a
      higher value of P4.debug will also log additional information as
      DEBUG. The logging reporting level in the assigned logger and
      handlers must be set to the correct level to see any log output.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2014.1

  #779528 (Job #64555) * ***
      Added P4.is_ignored(<path>), which allows a user to determine
      whether a particular file is ignored via the P4IGNORE feature.
      <path> needs to be a local relative or absolute path.
      Call P4.ignore_file to see which P4IGNORE file is used. Setting
      P4.ignore_file has to happen before the first time P4.is_ignored()
      is used and has no influence on the environment.

  #706047 (Job #64849) *
      Added context manager for temporary workspaces in P4Python.
      P4.temp_client(prefix, template) will create a temporary workspace
      based on the template. The client workspace name starts with the
      prefix to make it easy to exclude the workspace from the spec depot.
      Use this feature with the Python "with" keyword.

Bugs fixed in 2014.1

  #895310 (Job #74027) *
      If a form-out trigger prints out a message before sending the spec,
      P4#fetch_spec would swallow the spec file (such as change or client)
      and only print the message. This is now fixed.

  #736768 *
      P4Python now builds on Mac OSX Maverick (i.e. Darwin 13)
      P4.identify() will report P4PYTHON/DARWIN100X86_64

  #706046 (Job #68737)*
      Fixed P4.iterate to reject illegal commands.

  #693300 (Big #69143) *
      Added P4.disable_tmp_cleanup to prevent cleanup if temporary
      objects. Invoke this before connecting if you are using multiple P4
      connections in parallel in a multi-threaded Python application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs fixed in 2013.1

  #628525 *
      When using Python 3.X P4Python created a memory leak for
      every call. This has now been fixed. Note that the
      fix requires upgrading to Python 3.3. All previous version of
      Python 3.X are not supported and P4Python 2013.1 will not
      compile with these releases.

  #634817 *
      Reformatted P4.py to use spaces instead of tabs, following
      the Python coding standard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2012.3

  #533539 *
      P4Python is now compatible with Python 3.3 and will complete
      all test cases.

  #564572 (Job #59272) *
      Comments in forms are now preserved in the spec object when using
      P4.parse_spec. The comment can be accessed and changed through the
      P4.Spec.comment attribute. Comments are used by the P4.format_spec
      methods such as P4.format_client(). This is useful for form-out
      triggers.

  #568867 *
      When decoding strings in Python 3 from a non-Unicode Perforce
      server, P4Python normally assumes that all strings are encoded in
      UTF8. P4.encoding can be set to a legal Python encoding to change
      the decoding of any content from the Perforce Server. If P4.encoding
      is set, any decoding error will cause an exception to be thrown.
      The special encoding 'raw' can be used to receive Python bytes
      instead of Unicode strings.
      P4.encoding is only available when compiled with Python 3.

Bugs fixed in 2012.3

  #564572 (Job #32834) *
      In Python 3 it was impossible to reset the charset to None or ''.
      This is now fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2012.2

  #524819 (Job #59800) *
      P4Python now supports Apple Mountain Lion (10.8).

  #503392 (Job #56081) *
      P4.run_print() would return None for a non-existing file.
      Now it returns [] for consistency.

  #503375 (Job #56479) *
      Added P4.run_tickets() method to list local tickets.
      Note that P4.run('tickets') still gives the old error
      message "Must upgrade to 2004.2 p4 to access tickets."

  #498110 (Job #56512) * ** ***
      Support for the new progress indicator API. P4Python
      supplies a new progress attribute, which can take an
      instance of P4.Progress class or subclass. Progress
      information is currently only supported for submits and
      sync -q. Details can be found in the documentation.

  #491236 (Job #57828) *
      New convenience method P4.iterate_<specs>() that allows
      easy iteration through some or all spec objects such as
      clients or changes. Details can be found in the documentation.

Bugs fixed in 2012.2

  #513715 (Job #59191) *
      Fixed a bug where P4Python would leak memory when calling
      an OutputHandler, and would leak more memory if the
      OutputHandler returned HANDLED.

   #512425 (Job #58722) *
      P4#parse_client could raise the exception "Unknown field name
      'StreamAtChange'." when parsing a stream client workspace.
      Internal spec definition has been updated to resolve this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2012.1

  #403096 (Job #51898) * ** ***
      Enable "action resolve" to support resolves of branches,
      deletes and file types. The existing P4.Resolver class
      has been extended with a new method actionResolve() that
      will be invoked if an "action resolve" is required.
      Details can be found in the documentation.

  #411866 (Job #51896) * ** ***
      P4Python supports SSL connections if compiled with SSL
      support. Instructions on how to compile with SSL support can
      be found at the top of this document under "Building P4Python
      from Source" and in the documentation.

      P4.identify() will then report the version of the OpenSSL
      library used for building the Perforce C++ API (not the
      version P4Python is linked against).

Bugs fixed in 2012.1:

  #510916 (Job #59060) *
      Fixed a bug where P4Python would increment the reference
      count of an OutputHandler each time run was called.

  #446148 (Job #55062) *
      Fixed a test hardness due an incompatibility with Python 2.6

  #397007 (Job #49820) *
      A fatal server error would leave P4Python in an undefined
      state which would result in incorrect output for
      successive commands. P4Python will now disconnect and
      clean up when encountering a fatal error.

  #420204 (Job #52909) *
      Python would crash with a segmentation fault if a custom
      Resolver object was used to resolve binary files. Fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2011.1

  #328169 (Job #45862) * **
      Enable streams in P4Python by default. With this change,
      streams specific specs such as streams depots are listed.
      Disable the listing of streams specific specs by either
      setting the api_level to a value below 70 or by disabling
      stream handling explicitly through the P4.streams attribute:

        p4.streams = False

  #318056 *
      All run methods now support keyword arguments in order
      to disable 'tagged' mode or to provide an OutputHandler
      for a single command only without having to wrap the command
      in a 'with' block:

    p4.run_counter('mycounter', tagged = False)
    p4.run_files('//...', handler = MyOutputHandler() )

      More than one keyword argument can be provided if required.
      All attributes that can be changed for an active connection
      can be provided as keyword arguments.

  #317619 (Job #42251) *
      P4Python supports a callback interface by providing a
      P4.handler attribute. Set P4.handler to an instance of a
      subclass of P4.OutputHandler to enable callbacks.
      When a handler is defined, P4Python will invoke the handler
      for every response it receives from the Perforce Server
      immediately instead of collecting all results together in
      an array first. This can be used to make applications more
      scalable and more responsive if large results are expected.
      See the documentation for details on the OutputHandler class.

  #331330 (Job #43211) *
      P4Python now allows setting P4 registry values on Windows and
      Mac OS. P4.set_env(name, value) sets an entry and P4.set_env(name)
      deletes the entry. This is equivalent to running
      'p4 set name=value' from the command line.

Bugs fixed in 2011.1

  #385159 (Job #49324) ***
      On Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 2008, a client running as
      Administrator would fail to properly process file names in
      non-ASCII character sets (such as Shift-JIS).

  #328989 (Job #44038) *
      Prevent users from assigning non-string values to spec
      objects such as labels or client workspaces. Assigning
      values other than strings could crash P4Python.

  #328975 (Job #45395) *
      Updated the stored spec templates for user, client and change
      and added streams. These are required, for example,
      for form-triggers that do not connect to the server first.

  #328952 (Job #45956) *
      Under some circumstances P4Python would try to raise
      a P4Error, which has been renamed to P4Exception.
      This is now fixed.

  #328223 (Job #44820) *
      P4.identify() reports the platform on Mac OS as DARWIN in line
      with all other Perforce products.

  #328187 (Job #44819) *
      P4.identify() now reports P4Python as P4PYTHON in line with
      all other Perforce products.

  #326428 (Job #46255) *
      P4.Map.reverse would return a P4API.P4Map object. It now
      returns an instance of P4.Map instead.

  #323887 (Job #46151) *
      P4.run_filelog() would throw an exception for rare
      circumstances where no digest is defined for for a deleted
      revision that was later readed. This is now fixed.

  #312206 (Job #44742) *
      Info messages were not shown when an exception was thrown.
      This is because all messages of type info get silently
      swallowed. They will still not show in the output with this
      change, but they will be logged in the P4.message list.
      Info messages like this will be forwarded to the OutputHandler
      if present.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2010.2

  #257896 (Job #38952) *
          P4Python now comes in a Perforce standardized directory
          structure: p4python-<year>.<release>.<patchlevel>[-BETA].
          Source and binary distributions created via 'python setup.py'
          will follow this naming scheme.

  #257263 (Job #37856) *
          Python 3.1 is now fully supported. It also has full support
          for Unicode-enabled Perforce Servers. This also means that
          P4.charset can be set to multibyte charsets such as UTF16.

  #257099 (Job #38766) * ***
      Errors and warnings are now instances of P4Message.
      This object has the additional methods generic(),
      severity() and (unique) msgid(), which makes parsing
      of error messages easier.
      P4.warnings and P4.errors still return the errors and
      warnings as strings for backwards compatibility.

  #239278 (Job #38210) *
      Added new SetTrack() and GetTrack() methods.
      For more details about server performance tracking see:
          http://kb.perforce.com/article/883

Bugs fixed in 2010.2

  #285704 (Job #43213) *
          The connect() context would silently swallow exceptions
          thrown within the block. This means problems within the
          following code would get missed unless explicitly caught
          within the block:

          with p4.connect():
              # do something with p4
          # automatically disconnected

          This is now fixed.

      #287034 (Job #43415) *
          Running 'print' on a file that started with '---' would
          crash Python. This is now fixed.
          There is still an oddity when p4.track = 1 and a user runs
          p4.run_print() on a file that only has lines starting with
          '--- '. In that case, the output of the print is lost.
          Disable tracking by setting p4.track = 0 (the default) will
          solve this problem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2010.1

  #235589 (Job #35946) *
      Compatibility with Python 3. This change makes P4Python
      incompatible with Python 2.5 and prior, but retains
      compatibility with Python 2.6 (Python 2.7 also works
      but is unsupported).
      Python 3.1 is currently only experimental because of
      Unicode and 8-bit ASCII support. P4Python 2010.1 with
      Python 3.1 at the moment only supports 7-bit ASCII
      on non-Unicode servers and UTF8 on Unicode servers.

  #231765 *
      Added new P4.server_unicode attribute that allows script
      writers to test whether or not a Perforce Server is in
      internationalized (unicode) mode.

      P4.server_case_insensitive() has been changed from a method
      to an attribute (that is, no brackets)

      P4.server_level, P4.server_unicode and
      P4.server_case_insensitive all will send a "info" command to
      the server upon invocation if no previous command was sent
      before. Previously, these commands would throw an exception
      instead.

  #230480 *
      New read-only string attributes PATCHLEVEL and OS
      so that script writers can test the installation of P4Python
      without having to parse the output of P4.identify()

Bugs fixed in 2010.1

  #242158 (Job #38677) *
      P4.identify() now correctly report 'NTX64' for 64-bit
      builds on Windows.

  #230649 (Job #37434) *
      All keyword arguments passed in the constructor are now
      evaluated correctly.

  #235706 *
      Support for P4.run_print() for more than one file.
      Previously, P4.run_print() would throw an exception
      when trying to print more than one file.

  #235718 (Job #37841) *
      P4.RAISE_ERROR has been renamed to P4.RAISE_ERRORS
      for consistency with P4Ruby. P4.RAISE_ERROR is still
      available for backwards compatibility.

  #235730 (Job #37186) *
      Under rare circumstances P4.run_filelog() would throw an
      "Index out of range" error for "fileSize" fields. This is
      now prevented.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2009.2

  #214490 (Job #35417 ) *
      New P4.server_case_sensitive() method enables scripts to
      detect whether the server is case-sensitive. Can be called
      only after a command has been issued to the server.

  #214611 (Job #032917) *
      Throw a P4Exception if user attempts to change the port after
      a connection is established.

  #215413 (Job #31789) *
      Throw an exception if a user tries to set a charset wider
      than one byte. Previously, all commands subsequent to
      setting a multi-byte charset returned empty strings.

Bugs fixed in 2009.2

  #227423 (Job #37143) *
      The build script removed the release notes when invoked. Fixed.

  #214614 (Job #34866) *
      The P4.connected() method now correctly resets the flag when
      detecting a dropped connection.

  #215406 *
      P4.__enter__() now correctly returns self, which permits the
      following idiom to work correctly:

      with p4.connect() as p:
      # use p here as an alias

  #209643 (Job #36223) *
      P4Python now builds with the latest API on Windows using
      Visual Studio 2008.
      Previously, the build failed because of a link error.

  #222723 (Job #36558) *
      The Map class removed '-' and '+' from the path if the
      form Map.insert(lhs, rhs) was used, even if these characters
      did not appear at the beginning of the path.
      Now dashes and pluses are preserved within the path.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2009.1

  #191476 (Job #26731) *
      Support for the Python "with" statement.

      P4.connect() now returns a Contect Management object that can
      be used in a "with" statement with a block. When the block is
      finished, the connection is automatically disconnected:

      import P4
      p4 = P4.P4()
      with p4.connect():
          # execute statements here
          # p4 is now disconnected

      Also, there are two new methods, P4.while_tagged() and
      P4.at_exception_level() that, when used in a "with" statement,
      set the tagged mode and exception_level for the block and then
      reset it back to the original state. For example:

      with p4.at_exception_level(P4.RAISE_ERROR): # no exceptions
                                                  # for warnings
        p4.run_sync("//depot/main/...")

Bugs fixed in 2009.1

  #192108 (Job #32920) *
      P4Python now correctly parsse jobs when the jobspec contains
      fields with names ending in numbers.

  #191458 (Job #32834) *
     Charset can now be reset to the empty string ''.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2008.2

  #164805 (Job #30704) *
      P4Python now builds under CYGWIN.

  #163103 (Job #30363) *
  #166832 *
      A new class P4.Map has been defined in P4Python
      that allows users to create, and work with, Perforce mappings
      without requiring a connection to a server. Methods in the
      P4.Map class are:

      P4.Map()           Constructor.

      P4.Map.join()      Class method. Joins two maps to create a
                         third.

      P4.Map.clear()     Empties the map

      P4.Map.count()     Returns the number of entries in the map

      P4.Map.is_empty()  Returns True if the map is empty

      P4.Map.insert()    Adds new entries to the map

      P4.Map.translate()  Translates a string through the map

      P4.Map.includes()  Returns True if the supplied string is
                         visible through the map

      P4.Map.reverse()   Swap left and right sides of the mapping

      P4.Map.lhs()       Returns the left-hand-side of the map

      P4.Map.rhs()       Returns the right-hand-side of the map

      P4.Map.as_array()  Returns the map as an array

Bugs fixed in 2008.2

  #176515 (Job #31367) *
      Using P4.run_print() in untagged mode throws an exception:
        IndexError: list index out of range
      This is now fixed. P4.run_print() can be used both in tagged and
      untagged mode.

  #157855 (Job #29933) *
      P4Python now correctly loads the value of P4CHARSET from the
      environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2008.1

  #157600 *
      Added support for P4.run_resolve(). The default for
      run_resolve() is now to accept the merge hint provided by the
      server unless the hint is "e", indicating a conflict. In this
      case, run_resolve() will skip the resolve.

      P4.run_resolve() can also accept a "resolver" keyword argument,
      which should point to an instance of a subclass of P4.Resolver.
      The subclass should overwrite the method
      P4.Resolver.resolve(self, mergeData) and return a string
      indicating how the resolve should proceed.

      To get the old behaviour of "resolve", run the
      command P4.run("resolve"). You will need to set P4.input to the
      correct response in this case.

  #152008 (Job #28761) *
      Added support for Python 2.4.

  #152362 (Job #29024) *
      The 'P4.env( var )' method has been added to the
      P4 class. This instance method enables the caller to
      interrogate the Perforce environment, including reading Perforce
      variables from P4CONFIG files and, on Windows, the registry.
      P4.cwd now loads any P4CONFIG file settings that are appropriate
      to the new working directory.

  #153547 (Job #29310) *
      P4Python now supports Mac OSX 10.5.

Bugs fixed in 2008.1

  #175062 (Job #31637) *
      P4Python sometimes incorrectly decrements the reference count
      of None when calling p4.run_filelog(). In certain
      circumstances, this could cause Python to deallocate None,
      causing a fatal error. This problem has been fixed.

  #168966 (Job #31180) *
      P4Python did not release its output variable correctly. This
      caused a crash on 64 bit versions of Python when the P4 object
      went out of scope. This is now fixed.

  #166644 (Job #30723) *
      P4Python connections were not being correctly cleaned up when
      they were discarded due to a reference counting problem.
      This problem has been corrected.

  #161025 (Job #30076) *
      Fixed a serious memory leak problem in P4Python. Basically,
      all results returned from P4.run() had too many reference
      counts, which prevented the Python garbage collector from
      being able to clean up these objects. Now P4Python is memory
      neutral, as can be checked with the debug version of Python,
      which shows the total number of reference counts.

  #157844 (Job #28653) *
      Fixed an error with p4.run_filelog() when tagged output is
      off. The "df" variable is now correctly initialized on
      line 333 of P4.py.

  #156847 (Job #28770) *
      Calling print to retrieve the contents of a file no longer
      truncates content.

  #155969 (Job #29703) *
      When trying to create an illegal field in a Spec, P4Python
      would try to raise a P4Error, only to fail because the wrong
      number of arguments was provided to the Exception. This has
      been fixed.

Bugs fixed in 2007.3

  #149927 (Job #28703) *
      The presence of deleted revisions in a file's history could
      lead to P4Python throwing an error message. This occurred
      because deleted revisions do not have 'digest' or 'fileSize'
      fields. This problem has been corrected.

  #146116 (Job #28260) *
      The P4Python test harness, p4test.py, was omitted from the
      source distribution in error. This problem has been corrected.

  #146024 (Job #28077) *
      P4.Revision doesn't have a depot_file, or depotFile attribute
      as its counterparts in P4Perl and P4Ruby do. This is now fixed.
